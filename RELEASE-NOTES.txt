INTRODUCTION

This is a minor bugfix and maintenance release. A few small features have been added.

IMPORTANT NOTES

  (previously, CVS was used). Please see the jakarta commons
  website for details (http://jakarta.apache.org/commons).

* This release is done under the Apache Public License version 2.0; the
  previous release was under the APL 1.1. All files have been updated with
  the new license terms (including many files formerly missing license text).

Dependencies
=============
Commons-discovery has no dependencies.

NEW FEATURES
=============
* maven build process improved
* documentation moved from raw html format to xdoc format
  (best-practices.html, adc-guidelines.html)

FILES CHANGED
=============
* tools/ManagedProperties.java
   --> fix NullPointerException in setProperty method.
   --> added logging facilities to the class; debug output can now be
       enabled if desired.

* log/SimpleLog.java
   --> if exception occurs on System.getProperty, use a default instead
     of throwing an exception.

* ResourceNameIterator.java
   --> javadoc improvements only

* resource/names/DiscoverNamesInManagedProperties.java
  resource/names/DiscoverNamesInFile.java
   -->Generalize qualification of resource/file-names by prefix/suffix;
      add new constructors that take prefix and suffix strings
      for the resource to be located.

* resource/names/DiscoverServiceNames.java
   -->Generalize qualification of resource/file-names by prefix/suffix.

* resource/ResourceDiscoverImpl.java
   -->Defer creation of ClassLoaders until we need them, and create a
      useful default [non-null].

* resource/DiscoverResources:
   --> fix to compile under JDK1.5 (don't use reserved word "enum")

* JDK12Hooks
   --> PR: Bugzilla Bug 26875
       Added a try/catch for RuntimeExceptions in JDK12Hooks to avoid 
       NullPointerExceptions from JBoss' UnifiedClassLoader.  Reloading
       the Axis webapp after a redepoy of service classes then allows
       things to work normally.
   --> made class public (formerly, was package-scope only)
       In newer JVM/compilers, runtime complains when we try to invoke 
       setLog on a non-public class.

* JDK11Hooks 
   --> made class public (formerly, was package-scope only)
       In newer JVM/compilers, runtime complains when we try to invoke 
       setLog on a non-public class.
