1.  Jakarta Web site for commons subproject

2.  Figure out magic incantation for
    ClassLoader ClassFinder::getCallerClassLoader(Class rootFinderClass)

3.  Discovery::release() logic is weak.
    Caching is by threadContextClassLoader (removed broken
    logic...).  It's weak, and doesn't guarentee releases
    if your app plays with classloaders...  Need to
    go over this again someday.
