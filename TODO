1.  Figure out magic incantation for
    ClassLoader ClassFinder::getCallerClassLoader(Class rootFinderClass)

2.  Discovery::releaseAll() logic is broken.
    The goal is to allow a servlet to release SPI's that it owns,
    but NOT SPI's owned by other servlets (discovery is/could be shared
    in an appserver environment).  Currently we release everything...
    Perhaps change 'groupContext' from a String to an Object...
    and let such environs pass in a class instance (any class instance)
    which could be guarenteed to be unique..  more thoughts required.
    
    What we really want is release by classLoaders...
    which classloaders??

3.  ?Caching by groupContext... what happens if two apps in an
    appServer use the same groupContext.  I think this is OK, need
    to document analysis..
    
4.  Jakarta Web site for commons subproject
