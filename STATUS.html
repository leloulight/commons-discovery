<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h3>1.  INTRODUCTION</h3>


<p> The commons-discovery package provides best-practice algorithms for
discovering (locating) implementations of Java interfaces.
It includes support for locating/loading properties files,
caching-by-classloaders, and attempts using various classloaders.
</p>

<p>commons-discovery was heavily influenced by code originally
integrated into commons-logging, which was likely to have been based
on experience/projects related to the committers of that component.
</p>

<p>
Goals:
<ul>
<li>Portable across JDK 1.1.8 or above</li>
<li>Represent Best-Practices for locating & loading Classes and Resources in non-trivial environments (non-trivial classloader hierarchies).</li>
<li>Functional in standalone Java runtime environments</li>
<li>Functional within a J2EE environment.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Non-goals:
<ul>
<li>Replacing J2EE container managed services.  This means: middleware solutions
(commons-logging, axis, etc) that need to discover interface implementations
are encouraged to use this as they must remain independent of J2EE,
yet it is expected that these may be packaged as part of a
Web Application (WAR/EAR/JAR).
Applications/solutions developed for a J2EE managed environment should
NOT use commons-discovery.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<a name="Dependencies"></a>
<h3>2.  DEPENDENCIES</h3>

<p>The <em>Discovery</em> component is dependent upon the following external
components for compilation:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se">Java Development Kit</a>
    (Version 1.1.8 or later)</li>
</ul>

<p>The user must ensure that any service that they wish
to discover (use) are 'discoverable' by the application environments classloaders
(in the classpath, war/ear/jar file, etc) when they use this component.</p>
