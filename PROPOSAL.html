<h1>Proposal for <em>Service Discovery</em> Package</h1>
</div>

<h3>(0) Rationale</h3>

<p>
Service Discovery provides fundamental discovery pattern used in many projects.
</p>
<p>
It also provides the resources to make such discovery easily adaptable
for use within a project whenever/wherever a pluggable interface is
to be introduced.
</p>

<h3>(1) Scope of the Package</h3>

<p>
This is not indended to be a replacement to be used by the user, but rather
a replacement to be used directly by projects.  Use by the user is also reasonable,
but limited due to 'keeping this simple'.  In particular, there is no configuration
for this discovery service, it relies soley on usage patterns.
</p>

<p>
Given a java.lang.Class parameter 'package.Class' that represents a
fundamental service as either an interface, an abstract class
(or even a regular class), find an implementation of that class:
<ul>
<li>Look for system property named 'package.Class', the value of which is the
    name of an implementation.</li>
<li>Look for a 'local' property named 'package.Class'...</li>
<li>Attempt JDK 1.3+ style discovery</li>
<li>Attempt to load a default implementation</li>
</ul>
In all cases, verify that the discovered implementation <b>implements</b>
'package.Class'.
</p>

<p>
The package should :
<ul>
<li>Have an API which should be as simple to use as possible</li>
<li>Be based on usage patterns, not specific configuration file</li>
<li>Represent proper discovery & class-loading principles</li>
<li>Be reasonably portable across JDK levels (1.1.8+?)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>(1.5) Interaction With Other Packages</h3>

<p><em>Services</em> relies on:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Java Development Kit (Version 1.1 or later)</li>
  <li>[by design] Nothing Else, particularly anything that would be classified as a 'service'.</li>
</ul>

<h3>(2) Required Jakarta-Commons Resources</h3>

<ul>

<li>CVS Repository - New directory <code>discovery</code> in the 
<code>jakarta-commons-sandbox</code> CVS repository.</li>

<li>Initial Committers - The list is provided below. </li>

<li>Mailing List - Discussions will take place on the general
<em>commons-dev@jakarta.apache.org</em> mailing list. To help list
subscribers identify messages of interest, it is suggested that the
message subject of messages about this component be prefixed with
[discovery].</li>

<li>Bugzilla - New component "discovery" under the "Commons" product
category, with appropriate version identifiers as needed.</li>

<li>Jyve FAQ - New category "discovery" (when available).</li>
</ul>


<h3>(4) Initial Committers</h3>

<p>The initial committers on the Service Discovery component shall be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Richard A. Sitze</li>
  <li>Costin M.</li>
  <li>Craig R. McClanahan</li>
</ul>
